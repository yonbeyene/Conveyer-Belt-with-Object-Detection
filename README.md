# Conveyer-Belt-with-Object-Detection

In this project, STM32F429ZI microcontroller is used to interface with a conveyer belt which can stop an object using a photo receiver sensor. A program is developed using IAR Embedded Workbench IDE and a physical circuit consisting of debounced SPST switches, an H-bridge motor driver, a buzzer, a voltage divider circuit, an amplifier, LEDs, a graphical LCD and the STM32F429ZI microcontroller is designed. Below is the schematic of the project. The pins on P1 and P2 connectors are pins of STM32F429ZI microcontroller.
